# Embedded-Codes
These are the codes that were built during my practice for lab work at NIT Raipur in Arduino and TI Launchpads.

Examples of the code are present in TI_La* folder.

Most of the code here was also used as practice while making product for Texas Instruments India Innovation Challenge 2017 (TI IICDC 2017) , link[https://innovate.mygov.in/india-innovation-challenge-design-contest-2017/].
